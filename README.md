# ray-tracing-one-weekend-taichi
A fast python implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) using python and Taichi.

Taichi is a simple "Domain specific language" to use mostly pure python and run on the GPU.  There are other solutions for doing similar things, but my interest in Taichi was it's wide support for platforms, and this was an expirement to see and learn it. Learn more at [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi).
